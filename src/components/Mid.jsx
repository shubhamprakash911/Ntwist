            NTWISTâ€™s newest product unlocks up to $250/oz in previously
            inaccessible value in open pit gold mines by connecting siloed data
            sources like block models, fleet management systems, stockpile
            surveys, and plant instruments. This allows your company to better
            track material flow, and feed properties, identify plan/production
            discrepancies, and correct resource models and production plans.

            Oil and Gas plants require a high level of control and robustness in
            their operation due to the high risks to people and environment.
            NTWIST helps Oil & Gas customers to analyze historical data,
            identify opportunities for process control improvements, and reduce
            variability in any part of the process, thus providing enhanced
            reliability and safety.
